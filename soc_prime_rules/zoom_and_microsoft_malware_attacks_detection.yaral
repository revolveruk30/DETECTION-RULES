    description = "What's more, the researchers said they detected malicious files with the name \"zoom-us-zoom_##########.exe,\" which when executed, installed potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) such as InstallCore, a dodgy bundleware application that's known to install other kinds of malware. Additionally, we have detected malicious files with names such as \"zoom-us-zoom_##########.exe\" and \"microsoft-teams_V#mu#D_##########.exe\" (# representing various digits). The running of these files leads to an installation of the infamous InstallCore PUA on the victimâ€™s computer which could potentially lead to additional malicious software installation.
