description: The following analytic identifies hh.exe (HTML Help) execution of a Compiled
  HTML Help (CHM) file from a remote url. This particular technique will load Windows
  script code from a compiled help file. CHM files may  contain nearly any file type
  embedded, but only execute html/htm. Upon a successful execution, the following
  script engines may be used for execution - JScript, VBScript, VBScript.Encode, JScript.Encode,
  JScript.Compact. Analyst may identify vbscript.dll or jscript.dll loading into hh.exe
  upon execution. The "htm" and "html" file extensions were the only extensions observed
  to be supported for the execution of Shortcut commands or WSH script code. During
  investigation, identify script content origination. Review reputation of remote
  IP and domain. Some instances, it is worth decompiling the .chm file to review its
  original contents. hh.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64.
search: '| from read_ssa_enriched_events() | eval timestamp=parse_long(ucast(map_get(input_event,
  "_time"), "string", null)), cmd_line=lower(ucast(map_get(input_event, "process"),
  "string", null)), process_name=lower(ucast(map_get(input_event, "process_name"),
  "string", null)), process_path=ucast(map_get(input_event, "process_path"), "string",
  null), parent_process_name=ucast(map_get(input_event, "parent_process_name"), "string",
  null), event_id=ucast(map_get(input_event, "event_id"), "string", null) | where
  cmd_line IS NOT NULL AND process_name IS NOT NULL AND process_name="hh.exe"
  AND (like (cmd_line, "%http://%") OR like (cmd_line, "%https://%"))| eval start_time=timestamp, end_time=timestamp,
  entities=mvappend(ucast(map_get(input_event, "dest_user_id"), "string", null), ucast(map_get(input_event,
  "dest_device_id"), "string", null)), body=create_map(["event_id", event_id, "cmd_line",
  cmd_line, "process_name", process_name, "parent_process_name", parent_process_name,
  "process_path", process_path]) | into write_ssa_detected_events();'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives:  Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may retrieve
  a CHM remotely, filter as needed.
