datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies a service being deleted from the Windows Registry under CurrentControlSet\Services. 
  Adversaries may delete a service as part of defense evasion.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Registry 
  where Registry.registry_path= "*\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services*" AND (Registry.action = deleted OR (Registry.registry_value_name = DeleteFlag AND Registry.registry_value_data = 0x00000001 AND Registry.action=modified))
  by Registry.registry_key_name Registry.user Registry.registry_path Registry.registry_value_data Registry.registry_value_name Registry.action Registry.dest 
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Registry)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_service_deletion_in_registry_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: This event can be seen when administrator delete a service or uninstall/reinstall a software that creates service entry,
  but it is still recommended to check this alert with high priority.
