description: The following analytic identifies the execution of nslookup.exe tool to get domain information.
  Nslookup.exe is a command-line tool that can display information to diagnose domain name systems. This Nslookup feature is being abused 
  by Qakbot malware to gather domain information such as SRV service location records, server name and many more.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where (Processes.process_name = "nslookup.exe" OR Processes.original_file_name = "nslookup.exe") AND Processes.process = "*_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs*" 
  by Processes.parent_process Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.process Processes.user Processes.dest Processes.parent_process_id Processes.original_file_name

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_system_discovery_using_ldap_nslookup_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: dministrator may execute this commandline tool for auditing purposes. Filter as needed.
