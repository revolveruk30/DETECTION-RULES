description: 'Detect procdump.exe dumping the lsass process. This query looks for
  both -mm and -ma usage. -mm will produce a mini dump file and -ma will write a dump
  file with all process memory. Both are highly suspect and should be reviewed. This
  query does not monitor for the internal name (original_file_name=procdump) of the
  PE or look for procdump64.exe. Modify the query as needed.\

  During triage, confirm this is procdump.exe executing. If it is the first time a
  Sysinternals utility has been ran, it is possible there will be a -accepteula on
  the command line. Review other endpoint data sources for cross process (injection)
  into lsass.exe.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
