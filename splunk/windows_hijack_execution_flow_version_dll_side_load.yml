description: This analytic is to detect a process loading version.dll that is not in %windir%\\system32 or %windir%\\syswow64 dir path. 
  This event is seen in ransomware and APT malware that executes malicious version.dll placed in the same folder of onedrive application 
  that will execute that module. This technique is known to be DLL side loading. This technique was used to execute an agent of 
  Brute Ratel C4 red teaming tools to serve as remote admin tool to collect and compromise target host.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=7  
  ImageLoaded = "*\\version.dll" AND (Signed = "false" OR NOT(ImageLoaded IN("*\\windows\\system32*",  "*\\windows\\syswow64\\*"))) 
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image ImageLoaded process_name Computer EventCode Signed ProcessId 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_hijack_execution_flow_version_dll_side_load_filter`'
how_to_implement: The latest Sysmon TA 3.0 https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/5709 will 
  add the ImageLoaded name to the process_name field, allowing this query to work. Use as an example and implement for other products.
