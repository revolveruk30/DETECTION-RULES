- Endpoint
description: This analytic is to detect a deletion of ssl certificate in a linux machine. 
  attacker may delete or modify ssl certificate to impair some security features or act as defense evasion in compromised linux machine. 
  This Anomaly can be also a good indicator of a malware trying to wipe or delete several files in a compromised host as part of its destructive payload like what 
  acidrain malware does in linux or router machines. This detection can be a good pivot to check what process and user 
  tries to delete this type of files which is not so common and need further investigation.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
