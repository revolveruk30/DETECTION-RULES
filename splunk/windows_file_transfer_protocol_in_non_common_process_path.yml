description: The following analytic identifies a possible windows application having a FTP connection 
  in a non common installation path in windows operating system.This network protocol is being used by adversaries, 
  threat actors and malware like AgentTesla as a command and control communication to transfer its collected stolen information 
  like the desktop screenshots, browser information and system information of a targeted or compromised host.
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=3 NOT(Image IN("*\\program files*", "*\\windows\\system32\\*","*\\windows\\SysWOW64\\*")) 
  (DestinationPortName="ftp" OR DestinationPort=21)
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image DestinationPort DestinationPortName DestinationHostname DestinationIp
  SourcePort SourcePortName Protocol SourceHostname Computer user 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_file_transfer_protocol_in_non_common_process_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and sysmon eventcode = 3 connection events from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: third party application may use this network protocol as part of its feature. Filter is needed.
