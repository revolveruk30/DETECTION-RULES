description: The following analytic identifies a dns query to a known TOR proxy website. 
  This technique was seen in several adversaries, threat actors and malware like AgentTesla 
  to To disguise the source of its malicious traffic. adversaries may chain together multiple proxies. 
  This Anomaly detection might be a good pivot for a process trying to download or use TOR proxies in a compromised host machine. 
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=22 QueryName IN ("*.torproject.org", "www.theonionrouter.com")
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by Image QueryName QueryStatus ProcessId  Computer
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_multi_hop_proxy_tor_website_query_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name and sysmon eventcode = 22 dns query events from your endpoints.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: third party application may use this proxies if allowed in production environment. Filter is needed.
