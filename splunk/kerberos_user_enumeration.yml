description: The following analytic leverages Event Id 4768, A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested, to identify 
  one source endpoint trying to obtain an unusual number Kerberos TGT ticket for non existing users. This behavior could represent an adversary 
  abusing the Kerberos protocol to perform a user enumeration attack against an Active Directory environment. When Kerberos is sent a TGT request
  with no preauthentication for an invalid username, it responds with KRB5KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN or 0x6. Red teams and adversaries alike
  may abuse the Kerberos protocol to validate a list of users use them to perform further attacks.\
  The detection calculates the standard deviation for each host and leverages the
  3-sigma statistical rule to identify an unusual number requests. To customize this
  analytic, users can try different combinations of the `bucket` span time and the
  calculation of the `upperBound` field.
search: ' `wineventlog_security` EventCode=4768 Result_Code=0x6 Account_Name!="*$"
  | bucket span=2m _time | stats dc(Account_Name) AS unique_accounts values(Account_Name)
  as tried_accounts by _time, Client_Address | eventstats avg(unique_accounts) as
  comp_avg , stdev(unique_accounts) as comp_std by Client_Address | eval upperBound=(comp_avg+comp_std*3)
  | eval isOutlier=if(unique_accounts > 10 and unique_accounts >= upperBound, 1, 0)
  | search isOutlier=1
  | `kerberos_user_enumeration_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Domain Controller and Kerberos events. The Advanced Security Audit policy setting
  `Audit Kerberos Authentication Service` within `Account Logon` needs to be enabled.
known_false_positives: Possible false positive scenarios include but are not limited to vulnerability scanners and missconfigured systems.
