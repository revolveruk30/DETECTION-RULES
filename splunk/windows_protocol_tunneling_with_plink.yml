datamodel:
- Endpoint
description: The following analytic identifies the use of Plink being utilized to proxy egress or laterally in an organization. The analytic is limited to specific Plink options on the command-line, including -R -L and -D which will have the remote and local IP address or port and -l for a username. Modify the options as seen fit for your organization. 
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=plink.exe OR Processes.original_file_name=Plink
  Processes.process IN ("*-R *", "*-L *", "*-D *", "*-l *") by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`| `windows_protocol_tunneling_with_plink_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the organization allows for SSH tunneling outbound or internally. Filter as needed.
