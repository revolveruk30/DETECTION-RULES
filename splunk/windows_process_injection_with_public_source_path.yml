description: The following analytic identifies a process in a non-standard file path on Windows attempting to create a remote thread into a process. This Windows API,CreateRemoteThread, is commonly used by adversaries
  for process injection to evade detections or gain privilege escalation.  
search: '`sysmon` EventCode=8 TargetImage = "*.exe" AND NOT(SourceImage IN("C:\\Windows\\*", "C:\\Program File*", "%systemroot%\\*"))
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by SourceImage TargetImage signature TargetProcessGuid SourceProcessGuid TargetProcessId SourceProcessId StartAddress EventCode Computer 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` 
  | `windows_process_injection_with_public_source_path_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records process activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the processes node. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4
  of the Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Some security products or third party applications may utilize CreateRemoteThread, filter as needed before enabling as a notable.
