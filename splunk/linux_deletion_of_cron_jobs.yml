description: This analytic is to detect a deletion of cron job in a linux machine. 
  This technique can be related to an attacker, threat actor or malware to disable scheduled cron jobs that might be related to security or 
  to evade some detections. We also saw that this technique can be a good indicator for malware that is trying to wipe or delete several files on the compromised host 
  like the acidrain malware. This anomaly detection can be a good pivot detection to look for process and user doing it why they doing. Take note that this event can be done 
  by administrator so filtering on those possible false positive event is needed.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the Add-on for Linux Sysmon from
  Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator can execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.
