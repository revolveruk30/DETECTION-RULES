how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you must ensure that DNS data
  is populating the Network_Resolution data model.
known_false_positives: It is possible legitimate traffic can trigger this rule. Please
  investigate as appropriate. The threshold for generating an event can also be customized
  to better suit your environment.
